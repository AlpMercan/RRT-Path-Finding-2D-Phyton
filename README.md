# RRT-Path-Finding-2D-Phyton
Rapidly Exploring Random Tree using pygame for 2d scenarios
## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for path planning. RRT is a popular motion planning algorithm used in robotics and artificial intelligence to 
find feasible paths in a given environment.

## Features

- **RRT Implementation**: This project provides a Python implementation of the RRT algorithm.
- **Visualization**: You can visualize the RRT algorithm's progress in the Pygame window.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure the start and goal positions, map dimensions, obstacle size, and other parameters to suit your needs.
- **Collision Detection**: The algorithm includes collision detection with obstacles.
- **Path Extraction**: Once the algorithm finds a valid path, it can extract and display the path.
